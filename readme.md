## Github Pages

Create a repository named **yourusername.github.io**. On setting tab set what is good for. Create a file **_config.yml** :

* [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)

After that, help documentation is a little confused, two ways to continue :

* [Adding content to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)

  * [Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)
  * [Post](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

* [About GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)

  * [Configuring Jekyll in your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#configuring-jekyll-in-your-github-pages-site)

    I'am so disapointed because **_post** will never works cause :

      By default, Jekyll doesn't build files or folders that:

      are located in a folder called /node_modules or /vendor

      start with _, ., or #

      end with ~

      are excluded by the exclude setting in your configuration file
